In this paper, we propose an improvement to the anomaly detection method for IoT using Isolation Forest. The background of this study lies in the widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), where ensuring the security of all IoT devices has become a critical issue. This research aims to propose a lightweight and fast anomaly detection system, particularly suited for small-scale environments such as home networks, where implementing specialized security measures is challenging. The IoT-oriented IDS using Isolation Forest proposed by AbuAlghanam et al. is suitable for this scenario due to its lightweight and fast nature. However, it has two major issues: the need for manual threshold setting and the limited accuracy of the anomaly detection algorithm based on these thresholds. To address these challenges, we propose a detection algorithm that applies logistic regression to anomaly detection. Experimental results on two datasets showed that the accuracy improved from 82.1% to 90.7% and from 85.7% to 94.9%, respectively.

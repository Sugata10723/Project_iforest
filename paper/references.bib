  abstract = "In recent years, advanced threat and zero day attacks are
              increasing significantly, but the traditional network intrusion
              detection system based on feature filtering or based on a well
              known signature has some drawbacks. Accordingly, there is a need
              for security solutions that are suitable for IoT environment. A
              network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is a solution that
              examines network traffic and alerts system administrators if
              there are security breaches. In this paper, a fusion-based
              anomaly detection using modified isolation forest for Internet of
              Things (IoT) is proposed. The proposed NIDS has been evaluated
              using three benchmark datasets(UNSW-NB15, NLS-KDD and
              $$KDDCUP^\{99\}$$) in terms of F-score, accuracy and detection
              rate. Results show that the suggested approach reduces the run
              time by 28.80\% for UNSW-NB15 in the training model and achieves
              97.2\%, 97.4\% accuracy and detection rate respectively.
              Moreover, M-iForest outperforms other NIDS techniques that are
              selected from state-of-the-art relevant research found in the
              literature.",

               construct a profile of normal instances, then identify instances
               that do not conform to the normal profile as anomalies. This
               paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that
               explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points.
               To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been
               explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the
               proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent
               that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm
               which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low
               memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest
               performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity
               distance-based method, LOF and random forests in terms of AUC
               and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest
               also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large
               number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where

               self-protective tools against various cyber-attacks. However,
               IoT IDS systems face significant challenges due to functional
               and physical diversity. These IoT characteristics make
               exploiting all features and attributes for IDS self-protection
               difficult and unrealistic. This paper proposes and implements a
               novel feature selection and extraction approach (i.e., our
               method) for anomaly-based IDS. The approach begins with using
               two entropy-based approaches (i.e., information gain (IG) and
               gain ratio (GR)) to select and extract relevant features in
               various ratios. Then, mathematical set theory (union and
               intersection) is used to extract the best features. The model
               framework is trained and tested on the IoT intrusion dataset
               2020 (IoTID20) and NSL-KDD dataset using four machine learning
               algorithms: Bagging, Multilayer Perception, J48, and IBk. Our
               approach has resulted in 11 and 28 relevant features (out of 86)
               using the intersection and union, respectively, on IoTID20 and
               resulted 15 and 25 relevant features (out of 41) using the
               intersection and union, respectively, on NSL-KDD. We have

               Detection Systems (IDS) are techniques that can be used in

               The challenge that arises is that the IDS should detect attacks

               Companies are increasing their investment in research to improve

               of accuracy, institutions are picking intelligent procedures for

               attacks. The primary objective of this research focuses on
               applying ML-supervised algorithm-based IDS for IoT. In the first
               stage of this research methodology, feature scaling was done
               using the Minimum-maximum (min--max) concept of normalization on
               the UNSW-NB15 dataset to limit information leakage on the test
               data. This dataset is a mixture of contemporary attacks and
               normal activities of network traffic grouped into nine different
               attack types. In the next stage, dimensionality reduction was
               performed with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Lastly, six
               proposed machine learning models were used for the analysis. The
               experimental results of our findings were evaluated in terms of
               validation dataset, accuracy, the area under the curve, recall,
               F1, precision, kappa, and Mathew correlation coefficient (MCC).
               The findings were also benchmarked with the existing works, and
